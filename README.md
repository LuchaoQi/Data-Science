> Currently, there are thousands of resources online to introduce Machine Learning. This repo contains some awesome resources I personally suggest and summaries of different models for review purpose.



I would suggest checking [statquest](https://statquest.org/video-index/) at first to have general understandings of some basic algorithms.
