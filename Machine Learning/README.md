# Machine Learning

> Currently, there are thousands of resources online to introduce Machine Learning. This repo contains some awesome resources I personally suggest and summaries of different models for review purpose.
>
> I would suggest looking at [statquest](https://statquest.org/video-index/) at first to have general understandings of some basic algorithms.
